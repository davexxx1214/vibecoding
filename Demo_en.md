## 🎯 Project Introduction

### NestJS RealWorld Example App

A complete backend API implementation following the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec, built with NestJS + TypeORM.

**Project URL**: https://github.com/lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app

**Tech Stack**:
- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework similar to Spring Boot)
- **Database**: TypeORM + MySQL
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository → Entity)

**Functional Modules**:
```
src/
├── user/                    # User module
│   ├── user.controller.ts   # User controller
│   ├── user.service.ts      # User service
│   ├── user.entity.ts       # User entity
│   └── user.module.ts       # User module
├── article/                 # Article module
│   ├── article.controller.ts
│   ├── article.service.ts
│   ├── article.entity.ts
│   └── article.module.ts
├── profile/                 # Profile module
├── tag/                     # Tag module
└── app.module.ts           # Root module
```

**Business Features**:
- User registration, login, authentication (JWT)
- Article CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Article favorites
- Comment system
- User follow
- Tag management

---

## 💡 Why This Project

### 1. **Clear Layered Architecture**
```
API Layer (Controllers)
  ↓ uses
Business Layer (Services)
  ↓ uses
Data Layer (Repositories/Entities)
```

This layering is perfect for demonstrating the knowledge graph's **relationship tracking** capabilities.

### 2. **Real Business Logic**

Not just simple CRUD, includes complex business relationships:
- User ← → Article (users create articles)
- Article ← → Comment (articles have comments)
- User ← → User (user follow relationship)
- Article ← → Tag (article tag relationship)

### 3. **Moderate Code Size**

- About 3000-5000 lines of code
- Not too simple (loses demo value)
- Not too complex (hard to understand)

### 4. **Easy to Understand**

Based on Medium.com clone, business logic is easy to understand:
- Users publish articles
- Other users like and comment
- Users follow each other

---

**Operations**:
```
1. Hover over UserService
2. Click "Add Observation"
3. Enter observation:
   "⚠️ Note: findOne method has no cache, may have performance issues in high concurrency scenarios"
4. Save
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Hover tip shows observation
- ✅ CodeLens shows: `[KG: 1 observation]`

---

#### 1.3 Batch Create Entities (3 minutes)

**Operations**: Create following entities in sequence

| Entity | Type | File | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `UserController` | Class | src/user/user.controller.ts | User API endpoints |
| `ArticleService` | Class | src/article/article.service.ts | Article management service |
| `ArticleController` | Class | src/article/article.controller.ts | Article API endpoints |
| `UserEntity` | Class | src/user/user.entity.ts | User data model |
| `ArticleEntity` | Class | src/article/article.entity.ts | Article data model |

**Tips**:
- Can quickly select class name → right-click to create
- Description can be left blank, add later

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Sidebar shows 6 entities
- ✅ Grouped by type

---

#### 1.4 Create Relations (3 minutes)

**Method: Link to Entity (Quick link from current location)** ⭐

**Trigger**: Right-click menu or command palette

**Scenario**: You're browsing ArticleController and want to quickly mark that it uses ArticleService

**Operations**:
```
1. Open src/article/article.controller.ts
2. Place cursor inside ArticleController class (anywhere)
3. Right-click → "Knowledge: Link Selection to Entity..."
4. Select target entity: ArticleService
5. Select relation type: uses
6. Done!
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Success message: `✅ Linked: ArticleController uses ArticleService`
- ✅ Sidebar auto-refreshes

---

**Continue Creating More Relations**

**Use Quick Method to Continue**:

```
Relation 3: ArticleService → UserService
  1. Open src/article/article.service.ts
  2. Cursor inside ArticleService class
  3. Right-click → "Link Selection to Entity..."
  4. Select: UserService
  5. Type: uses (needs to get article author info)

Relation 4: ArticleController → ArticleService (call relation)
  1. Stay inside ArticleController class
  2. Right-click → "Link Selection to Entity..."
  3. Select: ArticleService
  4. Type: calls (calls service methods)

Relation 5: ArticleService → UserEntity (association query)
  1. Open src/article/article.service.ts
  2. Cursor inside ArticleService class
  3. Right-click → "Link Selection to Entity..."
  4. Select: UserEntity
  5. Type: references (needs to reference user info)

Relation 6: ArticleService → ArticleEntity (data model relation)
  1. Stay inside ArticleService class
  2. Right-click → "Link Selection to Entity..."
  3. Select: ArticleEntity
  4. Type: uses (operates article data model)

Relation 7: UserService → UserEntity (data model relation)
  1. Open src/user/user.service.ts
  2. Cursor inside UserService class
  3. Right-click → "Link Selection to Entity..."
  4. Select: UserEntity
  5. Type: uses (operates user data model)
```

💡 **Tip**: Creating more relations makes the visualization graph richer and easier to see dependencies between modules!

**Now we have 7 relations total**:
1. UserController → UserService (uses)
2. ArticleController → ArticleService (uses)
3. ArticleController → ArticleService (calls) ⚠️ Forms multi-edge with relation 2
4. ArticleService → UserService (uses)
5. ArticleService → UserEntity (references)
6. ArticleService → ArticleEntity (uses)
7. UserService → UserEntity (uses) ⚠️ UserEntity has 2 incoming edges from relations 5 and 7

---

**Verify Relations**

**Check Hover Tip**:

```
Hover over UserService:

📦 UserService (Class)
📄 src/user/user.service.ts:15-120

💭 Observations (1)
  • ⚠️ Note: findOne method has no cache, may have performance issues in high concurrency scenarios

🔗 Relations (2)

- Two simple icon buttons in top-right (⛶ fit window, ↻ refresh)

---

##### 1.6.2 Test Interactive Features (2 minutes)

✨ **Multi-relation Auto-separation Display**

Graph automatically detects and separates multiple edges in same direction:
- **ArticleController → ArticleService** has 2 relations (uses and calls), shown with different arcs
- **UserEntity** has 2 incoming edges, clearly separated

**Visual Effect**:
- 1st edge: Curves right (curvedCW)
- 2nd edge: Curves left (curvedCCW)
- Two edges don't overlap, crystal clear!

💡 **Tip**: Hover over edge to see specific relation type

---

**Operation 1: Hover to View Details**
```
Hover over UserService node
```

✅ **Expected Result**: Shows hover tooltip
```
UserService
Type: class
File: src/user/user.service.ts:15
Description: Core user management service
```

---

**Operation 2: Double-click to Jump to Code**
```
Double-click UserService node
```

✅ **Expected Result**:
- Auto-opens `src/user/user.service.ts` file
- Cursor jumps to UserService class definition (line 15)
- Code line is highlighted

💡 **Tip**: This is the fastest way to view code!

---

**Operation 3: Drag Nodes**
```
1. Drag ArticleController node
2. Observe ArticleService's 2 curved connections
3. Note the two edges curve in different directions
```

✅ **Expected Result**:
- Node follows mouse movement
- Connected edges automatically follow
- **ArticleController → ArticleService's 2 edges** clearly separated
  - One curves right (uses)
  - One curves left (calls)
- **UserEntity's 2 incoming edges** also clearly separated
- Physics engine slightly adjusts surrounding nodes
- After release, node stays in new position

---

**Operation 4: Zoom and Pan**
```
Zoom: Scroll mouse wheel
Pan: Drag blank area
```

✅ **Expected Result**:
- Scroll forward: Zoom in on graph
- Scroll backward: Zoom out on graph
- Drag background: Entire graph follows movement

---

**Operation 5: Use Toolbar**
```
Click top-right "⛶" button (fit window)
```

✅ **Expected Result**: Graph auto-zooms and centers, all nodes visible

```
After adding new entity, click "↻" button (refresh)
```

✅ **Expected Result**: Graph reloads, shows latest entities and relations

---

##### 1.6.3 Value of Relation Network (2 minutes)

**Scenario**: You've created 6 relations, now you can see a rich relation network!

**Observe Relation Network in Graph**:

From visualization graph, you can clearly see:

1. **Controller Layer → Service Layer**
   - UserController → UserService (uses)
   - ArticleController → ArticleService (uses)
   - ArticleController → ArticleService (calls)

2. **Service Layer → Service Layer**
   - ArticleService → UserService (uses)

3. **Service Layer → Entity Layer**
   - UserService → UserEntity (uses)
   - ArticleService → ArticleEntity (uses)
   - ArticleService → UserEntity (references)

**Layered Architecture at a Glance**:
```
Controller Layer
    ↓ uses
Service Layer
    ↓ uses/references
Entity Layer (Data Models)
```

💡 **Value Demonstrated**:
- ✅ 7 relations form a coherent dependency network
- ✅ Clearly shows three-tier architecture (Controller → Service → Entity)
- ✅ **ArticleService is core node** (most connections)
- ✅ **UserEntity is depended on by multiple services** (2 incoming edges clearly separated)
- ✅ **ArticleController has two types of relations to ArticleService** (uses and calls)
  - ✨ Two edges auto-separated with different arcs, see at a glance
- ✅ **Multi-edges auto-separated**: Don't need manual dragging to see all relations ⭐
- ✅ Label font large (16px) + stroke, clearly readable

---

**Optional: Add More Entities (Demo Purpose)**

If you want to make graph richer, can add:

```
1. Create CommentService entity (service type)
2. Create AuthService entity (service type)
3. Create relations:
   - ArticleService → CommentService (uses)
   - UserController → AuthService (depends_on)
4. Click 🔄 refresh button to view update
```

This gives **8 entities, 8 relations**, much richer graph!

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Observe Graph Changes**:
- ✅ New nodes CommentService and AuthService appear
- ✅ Auto-layout adjusts, avoiding overlap
- ✅ New relation arrows displayed
- ✅ Service type nodes shown as cyan rectangles
- ✅ Statistics auto-update

---

##### 1.6.4 Impact Analysis Using Graph (1 minute)

**Scenario**: Preparing to modify UserService, want to know what components will be affected.

**Operations**:
```
Observe UserService node in visualization graph
```

**Analysis Result**:

See at a glance from graph:
- **UserService** is depended on by **2 components**:
  1. ← UserController (uses)
  2. ← ArticleService (uses)

**Impact Assessment**:
```
Modifying UserService interface
  ↓
Need to update synchronously:
  1. UserController (direct caller)
  2. ArticleService (indirect caller)
  3. ArticleController (caller of ArticleService, may be affected)
```

💡 **Value Demonstrated**:
- Traditional way: Need global search + manual analysis (10+ minutes)
- Using graph: See dependency relationships at a glance (10 seconds)
- **60x efficiency improvement!** 🚀

---

##### 1.6.5 Auto-detect Circular Dependencies (Optional) ⭐

**Scenario**: Automatically discover potential architecture issues from graph.

**Smart Detection**:
```
Extension automatically detects circular dependencies
  ↓
Marks them with prominent visual effects
  ↓
Helps you quickly find problems!
```

**Example**:
Suppose we mistakenly created:
- ArticleService → UserService (uses)
- UserService → ArticleService (uses)

**Graph Display (Enhanced Effect)**:
```
    ArticleService ────⚠️ uses────⤴
                               ↓
                  ⤷────⚠️ uses──── UserService
         Gray lines + ⚠️ warning icon
         (Circular dependency auto-detected!)
```

**Visual Enhancement Features**:

1. **⚠️ Warning Icon**
   - Normal relation: `uses`
   - Circular dependency: `⚠️ uses` (warning icon shown next to label)

2. **🖱️ Hover Tip**
   - When hovering over circular dependency edge, shows "Circular Dependency" tip

3. **🌊 Arc Separation**
   - Two edges of circular dependency auto-separated, avoiding overlap
   - Forms beautiful arc shape

4. **🎨 Visual Consistency**
   - Line color, thickness, style consistent with normal relations
   - Only identified by ⚠️ icon
   - Simple, beautiful, not obtrusive

5. **💬 Console Warning**
   - Auto-outputs: `⚠️ Detected N circular dependencies!`

**Actual Effect Example**:

```
Normal relation:
ArticleService ───uses───→ CommentService
  Gray, 2px, solid line

Circular dependency:
ArticleService ────⚠️ uses────⤴
                           ↓
              ⤷────⚠️ uses──── UserService
  Gray, 2px, solid line, only with ⚠️ icon
  (Hover shows "Circular Dependency" tip)
```

💡 **Value**:
- ✅ **Auto-detection**: No manual search needed, extension auto-identifies
- ✅ **Subtle Alert**: Only ⚠️ icon marks, doesn't affect overall aesthetics
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Same line style as normal relations
- ✅ **Clear Tip**: Hover shows "Circular Dependency" details
- ✅ **Timely Refactor**: Refactor immediately after finding issue, avoid technical debt
- ✅ **Architecture Review**: Quickly find architecture issues during Code Review

**How to Trigger Demo**:
```
1. Create ArticleService → UserService relation
2. Create UserService → ArticleService relation (reverse)
3. Click ↻ refresh button
4. Immediately see red thick dashed line + ⚠️ warning!
```
